### Introduction
 Covid-19 is currently the issue under spotlight. It's having a seismic impact on our lives. Our project aims to provide a global view of covid-19. Our data is primarily the deaths and cases of covid-19 all over the world. To better visualize our data, we also plan to provide trending line and pie charts. We also have a prediction section that provides a prediction of the future trend of covid-19 cases, which is not common on most of the websites. Our model also supports customized data input and has a comment section at the bottom to share information you know in your neighborhood. Give it a try!
